--------------------


What is this?
--------------------

-AR-web -project is one truly amazing mobile friendly web app, which basically shows you stuff like text,images and video of the items recorded on your phones camera 'LIVE' , using Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality Technology. Sounds quite Futuristic right?

What is it made up of?
----------------------

-This web app is made on MEN (MOngoDb , Express , Node) stack , with Semantic UI backing it as a Frontend warrior.
-OpenSource Libraries/Frameworks used : AR.js & A-Frame (AR for Web)

Will it be working on every device and browsers?
-------------------------------------------------

-Uhm how about yes.
As far as compatibility goes, it works on any browser capable of WebGL + WebRTC, that would be Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. However, the current version of Chrome for iOS is not supported as of yet.


Why use AR.js and A-Frame?
--------------------------

To boil it down, itâ€™s essentially a Javascript framework acting as a port of ARToolkit, while leveraging other packages like a-frame and three.js. The goal being augmented reality features directly on web browsers without sacrificing performance.
