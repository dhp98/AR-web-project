# AR-web-project

Augmented Reality seems like it’s everywhere for the past 2 years. Between Snapchat filters, Google stickers, IKEA’s furniture preview, and now Shopify’s AR Quick Look feature, putting 3D objects in the physical world seems to be more desirable than ever.

Motivation Behind this project:
-------------------------------
To illustrate the power and efficiency of a single web-app integrated with AR technology.


How does it work and How to use it??
-----------------------------------

(This Web-App is much useful when used through Mobile Web Browser:)

1-It scans for Barcodes of 3 items,through your camera.
2-While recording through camera after Barcode is Scanned It displays
- text description of that item.
- Images floating on your barcode for next item.
- and it displays a video for other item.

To USE it:-
1-Press the 'Lets Go!' Button on Home page ,
  Bring your Camera infront of a Barcode image -from any of the above images.
